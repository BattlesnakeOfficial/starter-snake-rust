# Getting started with [Battlesnake](http://play.battlesnake.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=go_starter&utm_content=homepage) and Rust

![Battlesnake Logo](https://media.battlesnake.com/social/StarterSnakeGitHubRepos_Rust.png)

This is a basic implementation of the [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api) in Rust. It's a great starting point for anyone wanting to program their first Battlesnake using Rust, and comes ready to deploy with [Replit](https://repl.it) and [Heroku](https://heroku.com), or you can use any other cloud provider you'd like.


## Technologies Used

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Rocket](https://rocket.rs)


## Quickstart

The [Quick Start Coding Guide](https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/getting-started) provides the full set of instructions to customize, register, and create your first games with your Battlesnake! While the guide optimizes around local development for quick iteratation, you may choose to host it with [Repl.it](https://repl.it) or a provider of your choice. You can find advice on other hosting providers within our [Hosting Suggestions](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/hosting-suggestions) page.


### Prerequisites

* A free [Battlesnake Account](https://play.battlesnake.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rust_starter&utm_content=homepage)

## Customizing Your Battlesnake

Locate the `get_info` function inside [logic.rs](src/logic.rs#L9). Inside that function you should see a line that looks like this:

```rust
return json!({
    "apiversion": "1",
    "author": "",
    "color": "#888888",
    "head": "default",
    "tail": "default",
});
```

This function is called by the game engine periodically to make sure your Battlesnake is healthy, responding correctly, and to determine how your Battlesnake will appear on the game board. See [Battlesnake Personalization](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/personalization) for how to customize your Battlesnake's appearance using these values.

Whenever you update these values, go to the page for your Battlesnake and select 'Refresh Metadata' from the option menu. This will update your Battlesnake to use your latest configuration and those changes should be reflected in the UI as well as any new games created.

## Changing Behavior

On every turn of each game your Battlesnake receives information about the game board and must decide its next move.

Locate the `get_move` function inside [logic.rs](src/logic.rs#L30). Possible moves are "up", "down", "left", or "right". To start your Battlesnake will choose a move randomly. Your goal as a developer is to read information sent to you about the board and decide where your Battlesnake should move next. This is the code you will want to edit.

See the [Battlesnake Game Rules](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/rules) for more information on playing the game, moving around the board, and improving your algorithm.

## (Optional) Running Your Battlesnake Locally

Because [rocket](https://rocket.rs) requires an up to date build of rust we recommend you use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to get started then set the project to use the latest stable builds

**Note:** You cannot create games on [play.battlesnake.com](https://play.battlesnake.com) using a locally running Battlesnake unless you install and use a port forwarding tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

## Running Tests
We're look for a community member to produce a very simple test suite for developers to expand! If this is something you are able to do, please feel free to make a Pull Request.

## (Optional) Running your Battlesnake on Heroku

If you are interested in using Heroku to deploy your Battlesnake, you will need to [specify a buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks#setting-a-buildpack-on-an-application) as Heroku does not directly supply one for Rust. You can use the [Heroku Buildpack for Rust](https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust) and substitue the following Heroku commands for step 2 of the [Battlesnake Heroku guide.](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/hosting-suggestions/heroku) :
```shell
heroku create [YOUR-APP-NAME]
heroku buildpacks:set emk/rust
git push heroku main
heroku open
```

## Playing Battlesnake

### Completing Challenges

If you're looking for the Single Player Mode of Battlesnake, or something to practice with between events, check out [Challenges.](https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/quick-start-challenges-guide)

### Joining a Battlesnake Arena

Once you've made your Battlesnake behave and survive on its own, you can enter it into the [Global Battlesnake Arena](https://play.battlesnake.com/arena/global) to see how it performs against other Battlesnakes worldwide.

Arenas will regularly create new games and rank Battlesnakes based on their results. They're a good way to get regular feedback on how well your Battlesnake is performing, and a fun way to track your progress as you develop your algorithm.

### Joining a Battlesnake League

Want to get out there to compete and win prizes? Check out the [Quick Start League Guide](https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/quick-start-league-guide) for information on the how and when of our competitive seasons.
