## TO-DO

Lots of things are pending, this is a very unusable / not-competitive snake that I use to learn Rust and infrastructure stuff
 - Warped maps
 - The minimize part of minimax
 - Move opponent snakes during minimax (currently had been tested in solo mode)
 - Improve resource usage (par_map does a great job, but there is a lot of place for improvement)
 - Prepare a an staging snake (perhaps with a Github Action looking at staging branch?)
 - Prepare an infrastructure branch for automation the creation of Systemd services / environments
